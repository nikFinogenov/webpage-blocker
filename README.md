## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Project WebBlocker is designed to provide users with a robust solution for managing online 
distractions by blocking access to entire domains. The primary goal of this tool is to help individuals maintain focus and productivity by preventing access to specified websites. For instance, if a user adds the link "https://qwerty.ru" to the WebBlocker, the tool will automatically block all related domains, including "4qwerty", "qwerty.ua", and "su.qwerty.com". Instead of encountering a standard error page or being denied access, users will be redirected to a random Wikipedia page. This not only helps circumvent potential distractions but also encourages engagement with educational content, offering an incidental learning opportunity while maintaining productivity.
